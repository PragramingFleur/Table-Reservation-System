## About the Tablet System
The system offers a overview of the restaurant this application is made for. It shows the tables and are colored:

**_grey_** if available. **_red_** if a table is taken or a person who has reserved a table has arrived. **_yellow or orange_** if a table needs cleaning

It also keeps track of the table reservations the restaurant has. Reservations can be added, edited, and deleted.

The form for adding a new reservation has field checking to make sure the number is 8 digits or more, date is today or after, time is between 13:00 and 22:00, Adults guests number is 1 or more, and a table is accepted.

When a person who has reserved a table has arrived then the user of the tablet application can choose the reservation and simply clicked the arrived button to change the table status from reserved to taken.
