## About the Tablet System
The system offers a overview of the restaurant this application is made for. It shows the tables and are colored:

**_grey_** if available. **_red_** if a table is taken or a person who has reserved a table has arrived. **_yellow or orange_** if a table needs cleaning

It also keeps track of the table reservations the restaurant has. Reservations can be added, edited, and deleted.

The person using the application can also search through reservations using the mobile number

The form for adding a new reservation has field checking to make sure the number is 8 digits or more, date is today or after, time is between 13:00 and 22:00, Adults guests number is 1 or more, and a table is accepted.

When a person who has reserved a table has arrived then the user of the tablet application can choose the reservation and simply clicked the arrived button to change the table status from reserved to taken.
